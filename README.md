## Architecture

The application uses a multi-agent system powered by CrewAI:
- Researcher Agent: Gathers comprehensive information
- Fact Checker Agent: Verifies content accuracy
- Content Writer Agent: Generates high-quality content

All agents utilize OpenAI's GPT-4o model for optimal performance.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. JSON Parsing Errors
   - **Symptom**: "JSON.parse: unexpected character" error
   - **Solution**: The application includes robust JSON extraction. If you encounter this error, try:
     - Ensure your input content is properly formatted
     - Wait a few seconds and retry the request
     - Check the server logs for detailed error information

2. API Key Issues
   - **Symptom**: "Invalid API Key" or authentication errors
   - **Solution**: 
     - Verify your OpenAI API key is correctly set in environment variables
     - Ensure your API key has access to GPT-4o
     - Check if you've reached your API rate limits

3. Content Generation Issues
   - **Symptom**: Empty or error responses
   - **Solution**:
     - Keep your input text clear and focused
     - Avoid extremely long inputs (stay under 4000 characters)
     - For fact-checking, provide specific claims to verify

### Logging

The application includes comprehensive logging:
- Detailed JSON parsing logs
- Request/response validation
- AI model interactions
- Error tracking with stack traces

## Development Guidelines

1. Code Structure:
   - Flask routes in `app.py`
   - AI agents in `agents.py`
   - Templates in `/templates`
   - Static assets in `/static`

2. Adding New Features:
   - Follow the modular architecture
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Include detailed logging
   - Update tests if applicable

3. Best Practices:
   - Use the provided feedback tools for testing
   - Follow the RESTful API patterns
   - Maintain consistent error handling
   - Keep the UI responsive and user-friendly
